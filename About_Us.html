                <p>Hi my name is Reece Beans (yes that my real last name) and i've been fascinated by making the perfect cuppa/brew for as long as I can remember. I would hear the kettle get put on and I would run into the kitchen to make whoever wanted a cup the perfect cup, no exceptions. When I was a kid my favourite disney character was Chip, my granmama reminded of Mrs Potts. Before opening Bean & Brew I traveled across the globe Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam and many others all with the goal of finding the perfect bean, traveled all across the asian continents to find the perfect tea leaves. We train our artisans extensively in a 3 month boot camp experience to ensure only the purest of drinks are being made. </p>
